# Ocean-Zones
A website to explore the ocean's different depth zones (to scale).

This website is about presenting the depth of Earth's oceans through a single web page.
On the site, 1 centimeter represents 2 meters, roughly the height of a human adult.
By scrolling, the user can "dive deeper" into the ocean.
All of the ocean's zones are delineated with markers, and the current "depth" is constantly reported.

Along the user's journey to the bottom of the ocean, significant events are marked, such as deep diving fauna or notable geological features.
A sidebar navigation is provided (also to scale) which can be used to jump between these events.

As the user goes deeper, the musical environment changes as well, as different tracks fade out, resulting in a more simplified composition.
